## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a well-known task in the realm of natural language processing. Given a set of texts, the objective is to determine the sentiment of that text. This example demonstrates the use of Keras to perform sentiment analysis from movie reviews.

## Key components needed to run this example

1. An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) (free trials are available).
2. An installed copy of Azure Machine Learning Workbench with a workspace created.
3. The deployment part of this example is run on a Linux DSVM.
